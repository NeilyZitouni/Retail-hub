# Retail Hub - E-commerce Backend 🇩🇿

## Overview

Retail Hub is a comprehensive e-commerce backend system designed as an alternative to international platforms like Amazon. This project aims to strengthen Algeria's digital economy by providing a robust, locally-developed e-commerce solution that reduces dependency on foreign platforms and keeps economic value within the region.

## Mission & Vision 🎯

### Supporting Local Economy
- **Economic Independence**: Building Algeria's capacity for independent e-commerce infrastructure

By creating alternatives to platforms that may indirectly support harmful policies, we contribute to economic resistance against injustice.
